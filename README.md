###### • A brief description of your understanding of the problem.

###### • A discussion of your implementation of the search-tree node ADT.
The _state_ of the state space that this node corresponds to.  
The _parent_ node.  
The _operator_ applied to generate this node.  
The _depth_ of the node in the tree.  
The _path cost_ from the root.  

###### • A discussion of your implementation of the search problem ADT.
A _**list** of operators_, or actions, available to the agent.  
An _initial state_ **of the generic type State**.  
A _state space_ which are the set of states reachable from the initial state by any sequence of actions.  
A _goal test_ **abstract function**, which the agent applies to a state to determine if it is a goal state.  
A path cost function: a function that assigns cost to a sequence of actions. Typically, it is the sum of the costs of individual actions in the sequence.  

###### • A discussion of your implementation of the SaveWesteros problem.

###### • A description of the main functions you implemented.

###### • A discussion of how you implemented the various search algorithms.

###### • A discussion of the heuristic functions you employed and, in the case of A*, an argument for their admissibility.

###### • At least two running examples from your implementation.

###### • A comparison of the performance of the implemented search strategies on your running examples in terms of completeness, optimality, and the number of expanded nodes. You should comment on the differences in the number of expanded nodes between the implemented search strategies.

###### • A list of complete and precise instructions on how to run the program and interpret the output.

###### • Proper citation of any sources you might have consulted in the course of com- pleting the project. Under no condition, you may use on-line code as part of your implementation.

###### • If your program does not run, your report should include a discussion of what you think the problem is and any suggestions you might have for solving it.
