###### • A brief description of your understanding of the problem.

###### • A discussion of your implementation of the search-tree node ADT.

###### • A discussion of your implementation of the search problem ADT.

###### • A discussion of your implementation of the SaveWesteros problem.

###### • A description of the main functions you implemented.

###### • A discussion of how you implemented the various search algorithms.

###### • A discussion of the heuristic functions you employed and, in the case of A*, an argument for their admissibility.

###### • At least two running examples from your implementation.

###### • A comparison of the performance of the implemented search strategies on your running examples in terms of completeness, optimality, and the number of expanded nodes. You should comment on the differences in the number of expanded nodes between the implemented search strategies.

###### • A list of complete and precise instructions on how to run the program and interpret the output.

###### • Proper citation of any sources you might have consulted in the course of com- pleting the project. Under no condition, you may use on-line code as part of your implementation.

###### • If your program does not run, your report should include a discussion of what you think the problem is and any suggestions you might have for solving it.
